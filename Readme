Development Notes
API Rate Limiting: Alchemy has rate limits on their free-tier API. If you run into rate-limiting errors, try using a paid plan or caching your requests to avoid repeated calls.
Responsive Design: The app is responsive and works well on mobile and desktop devices. The layout adjusts automatically based on screen size.
Error Handling: Ensure to handle API errors gracefully and display meaningful messages to users when something goes wrong.
